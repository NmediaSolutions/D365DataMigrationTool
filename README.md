#Dynamics 365 Data Migration Tool
This project is a set of build and release tasks for Azure DevOps Server.

Improve your ALM processes and simplify your build & release procedures by automatically exporting and importing your data between your multiple Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement, or Common Data Service, environments with the **Dynamics 365 Data Migration Tool**. 

This task has the same objective than the [Configuration Migration tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-engagement/admin/manage-configuration-data) provided by Microsoft for Dynamics 365, but instead of manually launching exports and imports, you can automate them in your Azure DevOps build and release procedures.   

The project consists of a tool that can export or import data from a Dynamics 365 instance, and of two Azure DevOps custom tasks used to call the tool.
